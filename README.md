# Bankmanagement_System

Our Bank Management System application has a user-friendly interface that provides various functionalities for both customers and administrators. Customers can view and update their profiles, as well as change their passwords. Admins can add, update, and delete employee records in the database. The application is built using JavaFX for the front end and SQLite for the backend database.

The Bank management System is a JavaFX-based application that streamlines the management of customer records for businesses. The application provides an intuitive interface for customers and admins to interact with the underlying database, allowing for secure and efficient data manipulation.

Efficient management can offer high-quality service, and efficient management can be ensured by efficient organization management. So, professional management is only possible by crystallizing the authority & responsibility of all the personnel employed in a bank.
The Bank Management System Database Project aims to handle the crucial facets of overseeing client transactions in a bank. The main objective is to demonstrate using MySQL to execute basic database operations, such as creation, reading, update, and deletion (CRUD).
